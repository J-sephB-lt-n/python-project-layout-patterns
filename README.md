# python-project-layout-patterns

I am documenting python project structures in order to broaden my understanding of this topic.

All of the project layouts are in [/example_project_layouts/](./example_project_layouts/)

# Significant Observations so Far

* Include a [Makefile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_(software)) in the root project directory.

* It is trivial to add automatic documentation. Docs hosted on GitHub pages using mkdocs + mkdocstrings is an easy way.
